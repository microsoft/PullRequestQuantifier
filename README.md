[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=3YH6267UFS)](https://codecov.io/gh/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier)

A highly **customizable framework** to quantify a pull request within a repository
context **to drive a optimal PR experience**.

[Install our free GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/pull-request-quantifier)

<span><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/pull-request-quantifier"><img src="./docs/images/client-github_2.png" width="400"/></a></span>

[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-1es.pull-request-quantifier)

### Highlights

- Counts pull request changes with high accuracy
- Uses git history to provide a repository level context to the pull request
- Provides customizations through a yaml file for fine grained behavior control

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) is required for the framework to work properly.

  <summary display="inline"> <strong>Why proper sizing of changes matters</strong> </summary>
  <p/>
  <p/>  

Optimal pull request sizes drive a better predictable PR flow as they strike a
balance between between PR complexity and PR review overhead. PRs within the
optimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:

- Fast and predictable releases to production: 
  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer
  iterations. 
  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times. 
- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:
  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.
  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detected.
- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:
  - Small portions can be assimilated better.
- Better engineering practices are exercised:
  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.
  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.

#### What can I do to optimize my changes

- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately
  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)
  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the
  review complexity. 
  Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc.
  Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.
  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity
  by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. 
  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md)
  to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.
- Change your engineering behaviors
  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check
  if:
    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead
    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and
    code new features in the same PR).

#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output

- One line was added: `+1 -0`
- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`
- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will
interpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)
- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)
of this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.

  <summary display="inline"> <strong>How to develop new clients</strong> </summary>
  <p/>
  <p/>
Three steps

1. Load the context, if available
1. Call Quantifier
1. Output the results

```c#
// 1. point to the context file (with behavior specification)
var contextFile = "path/to/context/file/prquantifier.yaml";

// 2. quantify local git repository

var quantifyClient = new QuantifyClient(contextFile);
var quantifierResult = await quantifyClient.Compute("path/to/local/git/repo");

// 3. output the results
Console.WriteLine(quantifierResult.Label);
Console.WriteLine(quantifierResult.QuantifiedLinesAdded);
Console.WriteLine(quantifierResult.QuantifiedLinesDeleted);
```

  <p/>
  
  See [context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) for details of the yaml-based customization.

[Download latest version of context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases) and run it from the command line inside a git repository.
