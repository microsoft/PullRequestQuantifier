# Pull Request Quantifier
![.NET Core Build](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/workflows/.NET%20Core%20Build/badge.svg)
![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/PullRequestQuantifier.Client)

A highly customizable framework to quantify a pull request within a repository context.

Highlights

- Counts pull request changes with high accuracy
- Provides customizations through a yaml file for fine grained control over change counts
- Uses git history to provide a repository level context to the pull request

##### Why small changes matter:
```
1. Time to review.
2. Bugs are more likely to be detected.
3. Respect other people's time.
4. Share knowledge efficiently, small portions can always be assimilated better.
5. Release fast to production, small changes are always more likely to be released faster.
6. Exercise your mind to divide big problems into smaller ones.
```

##### What can I do to optimize my changes:
```
1. Quantify your PR accurately: exclude files that are not necessary 
   to be reviewed (autogenerated, docs, project IDE settings files, binaries ...).
   Check Excluded section from your .prquantifier file.
2. Split your problem into subproblems and try to code towards them.
3. Don't refactor and code new features at the same time.
```
##### How to interpret git diff:
```
1. One line was added: +1 -0
2. One line was deleted: +0 -1
3. One line was modified: +1 -1 
(git diff doesn't know about modified, will 
interpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)
```

  <p/>
  <p/>
Three steps

1. Load the context, if available
1. Call Quantifier
1. Output the results

```c#
// 1. point to the context file (with behavior specification)
var contextFile = "path/to/context/file/.prquantifier";

// 2. quantify local git repository

var quantifyClient = new QuantifyClient(contextFile);
var quantifierResult = await quantifyClient.Compute("path/to/local/git/repo");

// 3. output the results
Console.WriteLine(quantifierResult.Label);
Console.WriteLine(quantifierResult.QuantifiedLinesAdded);
Console.WriteLine(quantifierResult.QuantifiedLinesDeleted);
```
